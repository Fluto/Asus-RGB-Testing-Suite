A little test to control the lights on Aura Sync enabled devices

This lets you access AuraSync enabled device's lights through two methods:
-> Using the AuraDevelopment class (undocumented afaik)
-> Using the AuraSDK class (which is documented, but a bit slower to start up)

The goal of this repo is to figure out which one works for the majority of people. 
As I find that the SDK often results memory related exceptions relating to accessing the devices. 

This is designed for research gathering, not to be some fancy app. 
But if you want have a look at the code and use it in your projects. 
If you can get the AuraSDK to work reliable let me know. ;D

NOTE: The code is shoddy, but it's not designed to be fancy. kthxbye
